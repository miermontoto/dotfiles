We need a clean reinstall of the current node project. Follow these steps:

1. Remove all locks that are related to node.js installations in the current directory (such as package-lock.json, yarn.lock or pnpm-lock.yaml).
2. Remove all node_modules directories in the current directory.
3. Run the preferred package manager command to reinstall the dependencies from scratch.
