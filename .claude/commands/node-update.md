We need to update the dependencies of the current node project. Follow these steps:

1. Determine which package manager is being used (npm, yarn, or pnpm).
2. Run the appropriate package manager command to reinstall the dependencies from scratch.
3. If applicable, run the necessary commands to approve package builds (pnpm exclusive).
